        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>
            Science can be defined as a systematic study and investigation of natural phenomena and occurrences by way
            of observation, theoretical explanation as well as experimentation.
            A scientific study of any phenomena involves careful observation, formulation of hypotheses, conducting
            experiments to test and prove the hypotheses and henceforth drawing
            conclusions that confirm or deny the hypothetical assumption. Such scientific studies help in the
            formulation of universal laws that help humans to know more about the world
            we live in and how various natural processes and phenomena occur.
            Science is a vast field and concerns almost everything that our eyes can see or cannot see. Everything in
            the universe can be studied under the field of science.
            Talking at a basic educational level, science can be divided into three broad subjects – Physics, Chemistry
            and Biology.

        <h2>Commerce</h2>
        <p>
            The commerce stream after completion of Class 10 is quite a popular choice in India, as most students feel
            that the stream offers them a wide arena of career options to pursue
            after class 12, that would bring them both success as well as financial security easily. However, what most
            students do not realize is that just as is the case with the science
            stream, a student also needs to have a certain aptitude for commerce to be completely successful in it.
            Some students may choose the Commerce stream for this reason. However, it is a fact that if they have a mind
            that is more suited to a career in the Humanities stream, or even
            the Science stream, they would find it hard to survive and perform well in Commerce.

        <h2>Arts/Humanities</h2>
        <p>
            Defining humanities is a difficult task. However, it can be said in a few words that it is an academic
            discipline which deals with the study of the ‘Human Condition’,
            utilizing methodologies that are usually analytical, critical or speculative.
            The wide range of subjects that come under the umbrella term of Humanities range from history, languages,
            literature, law, philosophy, religion, performing arts,
            anthropology, communication, sociology, psychology and many more.
            Choosing the Humanities stream after Class 10 would enable a student to choose a career from a range
            spanning a wide area. Subjects that are available for study
            in the CBSE class 11 syllabus are History, Geography, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, English,
            Hindi and Sanskrit.

        <p>
            The Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc or BVSC; Latin Baccalaureus Veterinariae Scientiae),"Bachelor of
            Veterinary Medicine" (BVetMed), or "Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine
            and Surgery" ("BVM&S" or "BVMS") is a degree for studies in veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom and
            some other countries. These degrees qualify one to practice as a
            veterinarian in the US if the degree is conferred from an American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)
            accredited school and the candidate passes the North American
            Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE), just as any other US and Canada graduate. They are the UK's
            equivalent to DVM/VMD degrees; the main equalizer being licensure in
            the US.[1] On 5 March 2015, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) Council made the decision to
            allow UK veterinarians to use the courtesy title "doctor", to align
            with international practices. The RCVS president said of the change: “Whether one regards the decision as
            correcting a historical anomaly or simply providing greater clarity
            at home and abroad, there is no doubt that the issue has generated huge interest".
